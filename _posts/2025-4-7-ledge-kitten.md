Hi! How are you doing today? Have you seen any interesting animals? This is the story of one of my recent adventures!

We walked along the empty street. My friend walked behind me, her twin sisters and her mom in front. The morning air was cold, and the wind blew through the streets. 

“We couldn’t find one of our kittens this morning.” One of the twins told me. 

“Really? One of the new black ones?” I asked.

The other twin nodded. “She’s gone! We looked everywhere.”

“Oh no!” I gave her a sympathetic hug. “I’m sure she’ll turn up.”

We turned around the street corner. An orange tabby cat sat on the sidewalk, staring up at the overhang on a window.

“Oh. My. Goodness.” The mom stopped in her tracks. She pointed up at the ledge. I glanced up.

And there, sitting on the overhang, was the little black kitten. It meowed pitifully down at us. It’s little pink tongue hung out of it’s mouth as it panted a little. It’s body looked skinny, since it probably hadn’t eaten in over twelve hours.

“The kitten!” The twins yelled.

We all stared up at it. “How did it get up there?” The mom wondered aloud. “Wait, better question, what are we going to do? How are we going to get it down?” 

“What about dad’s ladder?” My friend offered.

“It’s too big. I’ll never be able to carry it on my own.” The mom pointed out. 

“Then I’ll help you.”

My friend and her mother pulled the ladder out of the garage. They held it between them and carried it slowly toward us, the kitten mewling all the while. 

Finally, the ladder was there. We all stared at it. 

I sighed. I hadn’t used a ladder since before we moved!

“Of course, the cat has to get stuck on a Sunday, when no one else is around to help.” The mom sighed.

“Excuse me.” Said a voice behind us.

We all spun around.

A man with a bike stood there. “Can I help you?”

“Yes please. My daughter's cat got stuck up there.” The mom motioned toward the ledge. “And I have no idea how to use this ladder!”

The man set his bike down on the sidewalk. “Let me see if I can help.”

Between my friend, her mother, and the man, they got the ladder unfolded in no time! And now, for someone to climb it.

“I don’t know if it will hold me.” The man studied the ladder.

“I’ll do it!” I offered.

“You?” The mom studied me.

I nodded eagerly. I haven't climbed a ladder in quite some time, but I do enjoy it.

“She is a fair bit lighter than me.” The man chuckled.

The mom smiled. “Alright. You go on up, and I’ll hand you the cat carrier.”

I stepped up on the ladder. Suddenly, it looked a lot taller. But then I looked up at the kitten, and I placed my foot on the first step. And then I stepped again. And again, until I was level with the kitten’s ledge.

The mom handed me the cat carrier. I placed it gently on the ledge, trying to give the kitty space to crawl in. I waited. And waited. And waited. The kitten paced back and forth along the ledge, staring down at the people below. And then suddenly, she was in! I scooped up the carrier and handed it back down to the people below. 
That was definitely not how I thought my walk to the cafe would go, but I would absolutely do it again! I love cats, and saving them is worth anything. I have to admit I was afraid while on the ladder, even though I’ve climbed things higher than that.

What do you think of my story? Do you have any pets? I wish you all an amazing day, and I hope you have the opportunity to pet a cat today! 


Sincerely,
Isla
