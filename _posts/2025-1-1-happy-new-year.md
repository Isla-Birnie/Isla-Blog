The paper lantern gently lifted off from the kids hands. It glided over the water, a character in its own special ballet. Suddenly, it fell gently. All the kids screamed, chasing after it, hoping to be the one to catch it and save the lantern. But there was no need. The lantern floated up again. All the kids relaxed, watching the lantern. 

Life always has its ups and downs. Just like that paper lantern, our lives are often hard and there are moments when we run underneath that lantern, trying to catch it before it plummets into the water. But God decides when you plummet and when you float. He will catch that lantern and wait for the hot air to make it float. God has you. God loves you. 

What have some of the ups and downs been for you in 2024? In January and February I was surfing in Barra with some pretty amazing people (you know who you are). In March and April we began heading North, pausing in Mazatlan for the beautiful eclipse. May and June were mine and my sister's birthday which were absolutely wonderful. Not to mention in June I got to go on a mission trip with my mom. In July we headed back to the USA to visit family for a few months, coming back to Mexico in October. From there, weâ€™ve just been going back South again, finally making our way to the beautiful community of Tenacatita and Barra de Navidad. Looking back on 2024 we had so many high points. There were definitely low points, but overall good triumphs, peace prospers, and happiness overflows. 

So remember, for this new year, to trust God with your lantern. He will be with you through the lows and the highs forever and ever. 

Sincerely,
Isla
