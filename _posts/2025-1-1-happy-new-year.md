The paper lantern gently lifted off from the kids hands. It glided over the water, a character in its own special ballet. Suddenly, it fell gently. All the boat kids yelled, chasing after it, hoping to be the one to catch it and save the lantern. But there was no need. The lantern floated up again. Nine kids relaxed, watching the lantern. 

Life always has its ups and downs. Just like that paper lantern, our lives are often difficult and there are moments when we run underneath that lantern, trying to catch it before it plummets into the water. But God decides when you plummet and when you float. He will catch that lantern and wait for the hot air to make it float. God has you. God loves you. 

What have some of the ups and downs been for you in 2024? In January and February I was surfing in Barra with some pretty amazing people (you know who you are). In March and April we began heading North, pausing in Mazatlan for the beautiful eclipse. May and June were mine and my sister's birthday which were absolutely wonderful. We had an early birthday in late May for me and my sister with cake and friends! Not to mention in June I got to go on a missions trip with my mom to Ensenada, Mexico. We visited orphanages, and handed out food to people on the street, praying with them and helping them in any way we could. In July we headed back to the USA to visit family for a few months where I got to go on a retreat with a church in Cupertino, and I got to see so many of my friends again. We came back to Mexico in October. From there, weâ€™ve been going back South again, finally making our way to the beloved communities of Tenacatita and Barra de Navidad. Looking back on 2024 we had so many high points. There were definitely low points like removing our mast in early 2024, and the heat in October, but overall good triumphs, peace prospers, and happiness overflows. 

So remember, for this new year, to trust God with your lantern. He will be with you through the lows and the highs forever and ever. 

Sincerely,
Isla
