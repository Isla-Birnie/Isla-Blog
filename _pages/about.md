# My Life!!!

<p> (Warning: being on this site can and will reveal you to speaking in all caps, and overuse of exclamation points.)
Hi!!! My name is Isla Birnie! I have been homeschooled my entire life and my favorite subject is writing. As a matter of fact, I'm an aspiring author with ideas, and a first draft! I am also part of The Young Writer's Workshop, a Christian organization that supports young writers on their journeys.
In my spare time I enjoy writing, surfing, reading, bullet journaling, and watercolors.
I live on a boat in Mexico with my family. I have a five year old brother named Patrick and a 9 year old sister named Margaret. My parents names are Robert and Dorothy (ages not to be disclosed lol) It's so nice to meet you!!!
Your new friend,
Isla :)
